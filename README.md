# Spatial-Research
Research done at the University of Maine under Dr. Yifeng Zhu looking to improve Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting using a Spatial Embedding. 

This research builds on the previous transformer models [Informer](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020) and [Crossformer](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Crossformer) by adding a Spatial Embedding to each model. An extensive look into the research is available in the paper. (LINK PAPER HERE). 

## Spatial Emebedding


## Data
This research was tested on many different datasets: [Weather](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/local-climatological-data/), [ECL](https://doi.org/10.24432/C58C86), [AirQuality](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5RK5G), and [Manufacturing](https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/8684322). 
The datasets used for both models in this research can be found in `Informer_Model/data/custom_data` with the exception of the ECL dataset. This dataset is too large and is found (FIGURE OUT WHERE TO PUT IT) instead. 
The datasets were preprocessed in Colab and can be found here: [Data Preprocessing Colab]().
